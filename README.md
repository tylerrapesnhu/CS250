Software Development Lifecycle
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-An important step in interpreting needs and implementing them into a program is asking why questions. This gets you to the root of what the person is asking for. If you do not clearly understand the ask, you cannot fulfill their request properly, which will lead to more work. When creating user stories, you must create clear instructions for what that aspect of the project is supposed to do. User stories define the ask to the development team. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-I hope to incorporate user stories in my future development work. Laying out exact expectations will allow me to develop exactly what is asked of me. I find that this lays the groundwork for a successful program. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-A good team member in software development keeps themselves accountable. They are able to stay on task and report progress on their work. A good team member follows guidelines and protocols in place by their team/organization.
